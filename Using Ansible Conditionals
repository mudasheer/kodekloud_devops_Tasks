The Nautilus DevOps team discussed how they can train different team members to use Ansible for different automation tasks. There are numerous ways to perform a particular task using Ansible, but we want to utilize each aspect Ansible offers. to the team wants to utilise Ansible's conditionals to perform the following task:

An inventory file is already placed under /home/thor/ansible on jump host, with all the Stratos DC app servers included.

Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and make sure to use Ansible's when conditionals statements to perform the following tasks.

Copy blog.txt file present under /usr/src/dba directory on jump host to App Server 1 under /opt/dba directory. Its user and group owner must be user tony and its permissions must be 0777 .

Copy story.txt file present under /usr/src/dba directory on jump host to App Server 2 under /opt/dba directory. Its user and group owner must be user steve and its permissions must be 0777 .

Copy media.txt file present under /usr/src/dba directory on jump host to App Server 3 under /opt/dba directory. Its user and group owner must be user banner and its permissions must be 0777 .

NOTE: You can use ansible_nodename variable from gathered facts with when condition. Additionally, please make sure you are running the play for all hosts i.e use - hosts: all.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

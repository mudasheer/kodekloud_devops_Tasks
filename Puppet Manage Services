New packages need to be installed on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. The Nautilus DevOps team has decided to install the same using Puppet. Since jump host is already configured to run as Puppet master server and all app servers are already configured to work as puppet agent nodes, we need to create required manifests on the Puppet master server so that it can be applied on all Puppet agent nodes. Please find more details about the task below.

Create a Puppet programming file ecommerce.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on master node i.e Jump Server and using puppet package resource perform the tasks below.

Install package tomcat through Puppet package resource and start its service through puppet service resource on all Puppet agent nodes i.e all App Servers.
Note: Please perform this task using cluster.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file

-----------------------------------------------------------------

cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests

vi ecommerce.pp

class tomcat_installer {

    package {'tomcat':

        ensure => installed

    }

    service {'tomcat':

        ensure    => running,

        enable    => true,

    }

}

node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {

  include tomcat_installer

}

puppet parser validate ecommerce.pp

sudo su -

puppet agent -tv ( on all 3 servers)

systemctl status nginx

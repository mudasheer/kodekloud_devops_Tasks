This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for one of the applications. Recently on of the customers logged a complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release. Therefore, the team wants to roll back the recent release.

There is a deployment named nginx-deployment; roll it back to the previous revision.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

----------------------------------------

kubectl get deploy

kubectl get pods

kubectl rollout undo deployment  nginx-deployment

kubectl get deploy

 kubectl get pods

kubectl rollout status deployment  nginx-deployment

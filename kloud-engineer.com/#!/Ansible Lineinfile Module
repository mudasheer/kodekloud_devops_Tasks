The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible only. Therefore, prepare the required playbook to complete this task. Find more details about the task below.

We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible on jump host. Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible on jump host itself.

Using the playbook install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.

Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:

This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:

Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!

Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0755 on all app servers.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.



Please Note :-  Perform the below commands based on your question  server,  user name & other details might differ . So please read task carefully before executing. All the Best 👍

Solution:  
1. Go through the folder mentioned in task and create inventory & playbook files

    cd   /home/thor/ansible 


2. Create a playbook file   as per the task  ( refer to Video below for clarity )

thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ vi playbook.yml

- name: Install httpd and setup index.html

  hosts: stapp01, stapp02, stapp03

  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: Install httpd

      package:

        name: httpd

        state: present

    - name: Start service httpd, if not started

      service:

        name: httpd

        state: started

    - name: Add content in index.html. Create file if it does not exist and set file attributes

      copy:

        dest: /var/www/html/index.html

        content: This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

        mode: "0755"

        owner: apache

        group: apache

    - name: Update content in index.html

      lineinfile:

        path: /var/www/html/index.html

        insertbefore: BOF

        line: Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!

 

3. Post file saved , run below command to execute the playbook
   
thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

4. validate the task by curl on app server and check
      
thor@jump_host ~/ansible$ ansible all -a "cat /var/www/html/index.html" -i inventory

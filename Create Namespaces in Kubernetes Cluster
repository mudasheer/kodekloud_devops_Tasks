The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to deploy some micro service on Kubernetes platform. The team has already set up a Kubernetes cluster and now they want to set up some namespaces, deployments etc. Based on the current requirements the team has shared the details below:

Create a namespace named dev and create a POD under it; name the pod dev-nginx-pod and use nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

-------------------------------------------------

kubectl create namespace dev

kubectl get namespace

kubectl run dev-nginx-pod --image=nginx:latest -n dev

kubectl get pods -n dev

-----------------------------------------------

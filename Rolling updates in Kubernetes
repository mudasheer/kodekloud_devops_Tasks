We have an application running on Kubernetes cluster using nginx web server. The Nautilus application development team has pushed some of the latest features to prod branch and those need be deployed. The Nautilus Devops team has created an image nginx:1.19 with latest changes.
Perform a rolling update for this application and incorporate nginx:1.19 image. The deployment name is nginx-deployment
Make sure all pods are up and running after the update

kubectl get deploy

kubectl get pods

kubectl dsecribe <>

 kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.19
 
 kubectl get pods
 
 kubectl get deploy
 
 kubectl get pods
 
 kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment

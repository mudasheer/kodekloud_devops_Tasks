One of the DevOps engineers was trying to deploy a python app on Kubernetes cluster. Unfortunately, due to some mis-configuration, the application is not coming up. Please take a look into it and fix the issues. Application should be accessible on the specified nodePort.
The deployment name is python-deployment-devops, its using poroko/flask-demo-appimage. The deployment and service of this app is already deployed.
nodePort should be 32345 and targetPort should be python flask app's default port.
Note: The kubectl on jump_host has been configured to work with the Kubernetes cluster.

kubectl get pods 

kubectl get deploy

kubectl edit deploy
<change image name as per question>

kubectl get deploy

kubectl get svc

kubectl edit svc

<chanhe node port target as per question>
